# WARNING: Beta code!

## Nodes

This version has three nodes:
1. Light On/Off (a light that can be swithed on and off only).
2. Outlet.
3. Scene.

## Prerequisites

1. You are going to need a 'real' SSL certificate e.g. from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). The public key and the private key must copied to your Node-RED server, in a location where the Node-RED service can read them.
2. You also need to be able to forward TCP traffic coming in from the Internet to your Node-RED server on a port you specify.

## The config node

**Local Authentication**

  `Username` and `Password`: A username and password used when you link Google SmartHome to this node.

**Actions on Google Project Settings**

  `Client ID`: The client id you entered in the *Google on Actions* project.

  `Client Secret`: The client secret you entered in the *Google on Actions* project.

**Google HomeGraph Settings**

  `Jwt Key`: Full path to JWT key file.

  `Report Interval (m)`: Time, in minutes, between report updates are sent to Google.

**Built-in Web Server Settings**

  `Port`: TCP port of your choosing for incoming connections from Google. Must match what you entered in the *Google on Actions* project.

  `Public Key`: Full path to public key file.

  `Private Key`: Full path to private key file.

## Google SmartHome Setup Instructions

See the developer guide and release notes at [https://developers.google.com/actions/](https://developers.google.com/actions/) for more details.

#### Create and setup project in Actions Console

1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
2. Click *Home Control*, then click *Smart Home*.
3. On the left navigation menu under *SETUP*, click on *Invocation*.
4. Add your App's name. Click *Save*.
5. On the left navigation menu under *DEPLOY*, click on *Directory Information*.
6. Add your App info, including images, a contact email and privacy policy. This information can all be edited before submitting for review.
7. Click *Save*.

#### Add Request Sync
*Note: I'm almost certain this part is not needed.*

The Request Sync feature allows a cloud integration to send a request to the Home Graph to send a new SYNC request.

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) for your project id.
2. Enable the [HomeGraph API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview). This will be used to request a new sync and to report the state back to the HomeGraph.
3. Click Credentials
4. Click 'Create credentials'
5. Click 'API key'
6. Copy the API key shown and insert it in `smart-home-provider/cloud/config-provider.js`
7. Enable Request-Sync API using [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/actions/smarthome/create-app#request-sync).

#### Add Report State
The Report State feature allows a cloud integration to proactively provide the current state of devices to the Home Graph without a `QUERY` request. This is done securely through [JWT (JSON web tokens)](https://jwt.io/).

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select **Create Credentials** and create a **Service account key**
3. Create the account and download a JSON file.
   Save this as `jwt-key.json`. You must copy this file to your Node-RED server, in a location where the Node-RED service can read it.

#### Final touches

1. Navigate back to the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com).
2. On the left navigation menu under *BUILD*, click on *Actions*. Click on *Add Your First Action* and choose your app's language(s).
3. Enter the URL for fulfillment, e.g. https://example.com:3001/smarthome, click *Done*.
4. On the left navigation menu under *ADVANCED OPTIONS*, click on *Account Linking*. 
5. Select *No, I only want to allow account creation on my website*. Click *Next*.
6. For Linking Type, select *OAuth*.
7. For Grant Type, select 'Authorization Code' for Grant Type.
8. Under Client Information, enter the client ID and secret from earlier.
9. The Authorization URL is the hosted URL of your app with '/oauth' as the path, e.g. https://example.com:3001/oauth
10. The Token URL is the hosted URL of your app with '/token' as the path, e.g. https://example.com:3001/token
11. Enter any remaining necessary information you might need for authentication your app. Click *Save*.
12. On the left navigation menu under *Test*, click on *Simulator*, to begin using this app.

#### Setup Account linking

1. On a device with the Google Assistant logged into the same account used to create the project in the Actions Console, enter your Assistant settings.
2. Click Home Control.
3. Click the '+' sign to add a device.
4. Find your app in the list of providers.
5. Log in to your service.
6. Start using the Google Assistant.
